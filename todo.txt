- create sample to show alert with the tab title, for a start
- decide on tech stack to use (asp? typescript?)
separate modules:
- module which, given two files shows their diff
- grabbing the two files via artifactory (keep user/pass in options? locally?)
- parsing page, show diff per request for each dvc file diff in PR
    for example, when the dvc change is selected, cliking the extension action button shows the actual diff; otherwise error/message
    - how about big files? try to reuse something existing for diff
- see https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/
- can the chromium extension open a sidebar-like part where based on selection the diff is shown?
- extend tool to grab the dvc files frmo custom sources (curl?)
- look for `<div id="diff-` for the diffs of files, select ones with filename ending in .dvc
- inject button in this diff
