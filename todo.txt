- create sample to show alert with the tab title, for a start
separate modules:
- module which, given two files shows their diff
- grabbing the two files via artifactory (keep user/pass in options? locally?)
- parsing page, show diff per request for each dvc file diff in PR
    for example, when the dvc change is selected, cliking the extension action button shows the actual diff; otherwise error/message
